# Error Handling

The application handles the following errors from Google Books API:

- 404 – Resource not found
- 500 – Internal server error
- 502 – Bad gateway
- 503 – Service unavailable
- 504 – Gateway timeout

---

# Logging

Application uses **Spring Boot logging** to log:

- API calls
- errors
- request/response details

---

# Assumptions

- Google Books API is publicly accessible.
- Only basic book fields are stored in the database.
- H2 in-memory database is used for simplicity.
